    '''Privatize a histogram for public release.

    This implementation relies on the following properties:

     - Each user contributes at most a count of one to at most one bin.
     - The categories (bin definitions) of the histogram are fixed and public.

    If these are satisfied, then the mechanism satsifies epsilon-differential
    privacy for epsilon = `privacy_parameter`, meaning that if any individual
    is removed from the dataset, the probability of this mechanism producing a
    different output is at most exp(privacy_parameter). This limits the amount
    of information any attacker (using any method or extra side data) can learn
    about one individual in the dataset.
